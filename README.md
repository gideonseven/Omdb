<h2> About this App </h2>
<p>Displaying movie app based on OMDB using MVVM design pattern, also using jetpack pro 
LiveData, ViewModel, Retrofit, Dagger. Support Load More listener for paging.<p>


<h2> Reason </h2>
<p>Reason why I'm using MVVM because its gonna be easier to implement the unit testing also 
modularity in code easier to maintain.<p>

<h2> Future Development Suggestion </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Implement Room for storing local data in android mobile, infact make it single source of data,
by using that, once device has connection for internet, data saved to local storage, and then display it to UI</li>
  <li>Implement Paging Android, which is already included in jetpack pro.</li>
  <li>Add new features in menus like save  or bookmark or maybe even like search by year or so on.</li>
</ul>
